The overarching aim of this study is to describe the natural history of patients with prostate cancer and provide an in-depth characterization of treatment patterns of patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer across a large network of observational data. 

1. To describe demographics and clinical characteristics of patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer.
1. To characterize initial treatment patterns (treatment type and treatment category) and outcomes including time to treatment initiation, time to next treatment, symptomatic progression and overall survival of patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer who initiated treatment
1. To describe the frequency of diagnostic procedures performed and time to receipt of diagnostic procedures from diagnosis with prostate cancer to initiation of treatment in patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer 
1. To characterize time to treatment initiation at each visit and to quantify the change in the distribution of time to treatment initiation during the follow up in patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer
